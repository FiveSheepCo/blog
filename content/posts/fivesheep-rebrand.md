# Welcome to FiveSheep

Hello to our amazing community,

As the sun sets on 2023, we stand at the threshold of a new era, embracing change, growth, and innovation. We are
thrilled to announce that Quintschaf GbR is now FiveSheep OÜ! This is more than just a name change; it's a
transformation that reflects our global vision and the exciting journey ahead.

## A Look Back at 2023: Quiet but Transformative

This year might have seemed quieter on the surface, but beneath the calm, the wheels of progress were turning at full
speed. While we released only one app, Polyphasic - The clean and modern sleep cycle tracker, its success and positive
reception were heartwarming. It's a testament to our commitment to quality over quantity.

Our flagship apps, MyKeyboard and Chatalyzer, continued to bring joy and utility to our users, receiving several
enhancements and updates. Your feedback has always been our guiding star, helping us refine and perfect our offerings.

## The Rebranding: Why FiveSheep?

We, Jann and I (Marco), founded Quintschaf with a vision to create innovative and enjoyable iOS apps. The somewhat
strange company name was an amalgamation of our surnames. As we expanded our horizons, reaching out to international
customers, we realized the need for a name that resonates globally. FiveSheep embodies this spirit - it's unique,
memorable, and bridges language barriers with ease.

Moreover, transitioning to FiveSheep OÜ and moving our business operations to Estonia is a strategic move. It offers us
more flexibility and opportunities than our previous company structure. This shift opens doors to more ambitious
projects, enabling us to dream bigger and reach higher.

## What's in Store for 2024?
The upcoming year is shaping up to be an exciting one! We have been toiling away behind the scenes on some incredible
new projects. Expect to see at least two groundbreaking apps in the first quarter alone.

Our focus on leveraging state-of-the-art artificial intelligence means we're not just keeping up with trends - we're
setting them. And for our loyal MyKeyboard users, get ready for a delightful surprise that will redefine your
experience!

## A Heartfelt Thank You
Our journey so far has been exhilarating, and your support has been the cornerstone of our success. As we embark on this
new chapter as FiveSheep, we invite you to continue this adventure with us. Stay tuned for groundbreaking apps and
innovations that will make 2024 an unforgettable year.

To innovation, to creativity, and to the future - welcome to FiveSheep!

Warm regards,

Marco & Jann   
FiveSheep OÜ
